  Death Valley National Park was so much more than I expected. Before arriving,
  my expectations were pretty low. I assumed it would be just a barren desert,
  but what I found blew me away.

  I didn't expect Death Valley to be as impressive as it was. I figured it would
  be just a desert, but boy was I wrong! Between the sand dunes, salt flats and
  painted mountains, it's safe to say I was blown away by nature's beauty. I
  watched sand storms over the dunes, and saw flowers blooming in one of the
  world's driest places. While I wouldn't recommend you visit in the summer
  heat, spring in Death Valley is something you should't miss!
