  Winter in Canada is truly a magical experience. From frozen bubble lakes and
  waterfalls, to frosty sunrises, Alberta is the definition of a winter
  wonderland. Throw in all the winter sports you can imagine and you have a
  winter holiday destination you've only dreamed about.

  There isn't a bad season to visit Alberta, but winter is definitely a special
  time. The Canadian Rockies are covered in snow, the lakes are frozen over, and
  most importantly, the crowds die down and you practically have the whole place
  to yourself. Visit Banff to watch sunrise over Vermillion Lakes, and drive the
  Icefields Parkway towards Jasper to marvel at the frozen waterfalls and
  snow-covered peaks. Detour to Abraham Lake, where you can view frozen methane
  bubbles under the lakes surface. Try your hand at skiing, snowboarding,
  ice-fishing, snowshoeing, or any other winter sport you've been dreaming of.
  Alberta truly is a winter wonderland!
