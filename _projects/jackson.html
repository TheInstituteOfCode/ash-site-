  Of all the places I've traveled to, Jackson Wyoming might be my favorite. The
  Grand Teton National Park has it all; mountains, plains and all the wildlife
  you could imagine.
text: >-
  Nestled at the base of the Teton Range is the small town of Jackson, the
  gateway to the Grand Teton National Park. Accessible year-round, this magical
  place is full of impressive peaks that tower over the Snake River valley
  below. Here you can find a variety of wildlife, including moose, bison,
  wolves, foxes, eagles and more.
