  Of all the places I've traveled to, Jackson Wyoming might be my favorite. The
  Grand Teton National Park has it all; mountains, plains and all the wildlife
  you could imagine.

  Nestled at the base of the Teton Range is the small town of Jackson, the
  gateway to the Grand Teton National Park. Accessible year-round, this magical
  place is full of impressive peaks that tower over the Snake River valley
  below. Here you can find a variety of wildlife, including moose, bison,
  wolves, foxes, eagles and more.
