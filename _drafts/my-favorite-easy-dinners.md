  One of the first questions people have when I tell them I live in a van, is
  "how do you shower?" This was my first question as well, so after a little
  trial and error, I put together a list of the 5 best ways to shower when you
  live in a van.

After a long day of driving or exploring, the last thing I want is to spend a lot of time cooking dinner.&nbsp;

When I'm really hungry, I go for the quickest one to make, vegetable and rice soup, with or without chicken. I fill a saucepan about halfway with water, and add 1/2 cup of rice or quinoa. While I wait for the water to boil, I add garlic and onion powder, vegetable bullion, various herbs, salt, and pepper. Then I add whatever fresh vegetable I have, I've made this dish with broccoli and green beans, but zucchini is my favorite to make it with. I keep frozen corn, carrots, and peas on hand and will add them in as a second veggie, or as the main ones if I run out of fresh veggies. Occasionally I'll throw in a can of chicken for some extra protein. I know what you're thinking, "a can of chicken? Gross." At least that's what I thought, but they're surprisingly good. I buy the chicken breast, and it comes out in nice, big chunks. I don't like the idea of raw chicken in the van, so this is a good alternative for a recipe like this. I throw it in during the last few minutes just to get it hot. &nbsp;After 15 minutes the rice is just about done, and dinner is ready to go! Flavorful, fast and healthy, plus enough leftovers for one or two more meals.&nbsp;

My next one-pot wonder is a veggie and pasta dish. Pearl (or Israeli) couscous to be exact. Pearl couscous is a type of pasta that makes a great base or side for a meal. It's also just fun to eat, the pearl size bites are a unique texture. I start by heating up some olive oil and toasting the couscous until its golden. I add 1 1/2 cups of water, some onion and garlic powder, a spoonful of vegetable bullion, and place the lid on to cook for 12 minutes. While that cooks, saute up the vegetable of your choice with a little olive oil. I only like this dish with fresh veggies, and broccoli is my favorite. When the couscous is done, there will be no water left in the pan. It can dry out quickly, so don't overcook it. Throw your cooked veggies into the couscous and mix well. I like to sprinkle feta over the top of mine, and I think you'd probably like that too. Add a little salt and pepper and you have a light, yet satisfying meal, in 20 minutes!
