  One of the first questions people have when I tell them I live in a van, is
  "how do you shower?" This was my first question as well, so after a little
  trial and error, I put together a list of the 5 best ways to shower when you
  live in a van.

Overnight oats is my go-to when I have a busy morning planned. It's such an easy and healthy dish to make, yet satisfying and filling. In a small container I add 1/2 cup of quick oats and then pour almond milk over the oats until it's just covering them. Sometimes I put dehydrated fruit under the oats for an extra flavor boost. I then top the oats with cinnamon, coconut chips, walnuts or pecans, and dash of vanilla, and then I drizzle the oats with agave. The container goes in the fridge overnight, and in the morning you have perfect oats. You can top it with fresh berries or bananas for an even more complete meal. I've never eaten these warm, I usually just let them warm up to room temperature. You can customize this recipe in dozens of ways, with different milks, spices, and toppings.&nbsp;

If I have a little more time, I'll cook up a breakfast bagel. I usually have a few savory bagels around, and I'll throw them on the skillet to toast up. When they're close to done, I pull one half out and place a slice of cheese on half still in the pan. I put a lid over the skillet, and turn the heat off after a minute or so. In another pan I fry up an egg while I spread cream cheese on the other half bagel. If I'm feeling decadent, I'll fry up some bacon or ham, but usually I just do egg and cheese.&nbsp;
