So, you’ve finally decided to buy a van. Hooray! Congratulations and let me officially welcome you to the van life nation! So where do you go from here? If you’ve made it this far, you probably already have an idea of what you’re looking for. If not, let’s start with the basics.

**What do you want to use your van for?**

Maybe you’re a weekend warrior looking for an adventure vehicle to explore awesome places. Or maybe you want to dive in head first, sell all your belongings and become a full time vanlifer. Either way, knowing how you want to use your van is the first step in picking one out. You also need to consider what you’ll be bringing &nbsp;into the van. If you have mountain bikes, consider how you’ll store those in or on the van. Do you have surfboards, paddleboards or kayaks? These are big items that take up a lot of real estate. Think about how much room you’re going to need to store your gear because that might be the deciding factor in which van you choose.

**To convert or not to convert, that is the question…**

Sadly my van is not the “Instagram” van that everyone desires. It’s not an old, cute VW camper or an amazing sprinter van conversion. My choice was based on situation, convenience, and price. As much as I would love an old camper van, I don’t possess the mechanical skills necessary to keep it going. Nor do I have the bank account to take it to the shop frequently. Instead I chose to get a van with low mileage that was mechanically sound. I also decided not to convert my van. Conversions take time and skill, neither of which I have. Maybe one day I’ll buy a cool Sprinter van to make my own, but getting on the road as fast as possible was my goal. Adventure was waiting and I didn’t want to spend 3 months or more getting my house on wheels ready!

**Where do you want to take your van?**

If you’re the extra adventurous type, you probably want to invest in a 4x4 van. They can be difficult to find and costly, but oh so worth it. I spend most of my time camping in National Forests, and sometimes I get nervous driving my van down long dirt roads. I have to be careful not to drive down muddy or snowy roads because my van would get stuck very easily. It is possible to convert a van into 4x4, but I’ve heard it can cost in the range of about $10K. At that price it might be easier to just buy a 4x4 from the start, but if money isn’t an issue, then I highly recommend a 4x4 for the ultimate ad-van-ture!

**Is a bathroom necessary for you?**

If you plan on using campgrounds most of the time, you probably don’t need a van with a bathroom. You can always use rest stops and gas stations for toilet breaks, and if you need a shower, there are a lot of portable options. I decided to live in mine full-time, so a shower and toilet was a necessity. It’s an extra hassle; having to fill water and empty tanks every few days, but I’m so happy to have it. Maybe I’m spoiled, but I honestly can’t imagine not having one.

**How much cooking do you plan on doing?**

If you plan to use your van for short adventures, you might find that a cooler and portable stove are enough. Since I live in my van full-time, I decided to get a van with a small fridge and stove. I wanted the ability to cook in my van and store food and drinks for longer periods of time. My fridge and stove both run off a 5-gallon propane tank, which I fill about once a week.

Buying a van is a big and deeply personal decision. There’s a lot to consider when picking out the right van. Sometimes you can’t get all the features you’re looking for, so figure out what features are most important to you. If you’re struggling with a decision, I recommend renting a van to test it out. There are lots of places where you can rent an older campervan or a new Sprinter van for a few days to try them out. I rented a van for a week to test it out before I made the plunge, and it was a fantastic decision. It’s also a great idea if you’re unsure of vanlife and want to give it a go before you commit to purchasing one. Just remember, no matter what type of van you choose, you’re signing up for the adventure of a lifetime and there’s no wrong way to do it. Van on my friends!
