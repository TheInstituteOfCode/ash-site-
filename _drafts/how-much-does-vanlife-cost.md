  So, you’ve finally decided to buy a van. Hooray! Congratulations and let me
  officially welcome you to the van life nation! So where do you go from here?
  If you’ve made it this far, you probably already have an idea of what you’re
  looking for. If not, let’s start with the basics.

One of the reasons people move into vans or RVs is to save money. Rent is expensive, and when you're trying to build savings or pay off debt, living in a van can be a great way to get your finances in order. Besides personal bills, these are my main bills associated with living on the road.&nbsp;

Fuel is by far my biggest monthly expense. As a photographer, I spend a lot of time on the road, driving to different locations. If you like to stay in one area for longer periods, you may not spend very much at all on fuel. I'm trying to get better about spending more time in one spot, simply to save money. But having a van makes it too easy to pick up and go when I start to get bored, the weather changes, or I just have a new idea about where to go next. On average, I spend about $600 per month on fuel, but that number can double if I take a long trip, to Canada for example. Stan has a 30 gallon tank, so fill-ups cost between $80-110 depending on how expensive the area is. I always fill up at half a tank so I don't feel so bad when the receipt prints! Stan gets a measly 13 miles to the gallon, it's one of his biggest faults. Each tank gives me about 400 miles of freedom.&nbsp;

I wasn't able to pay cash for my van, I had to take out a loan. Luckily it's really small; I bought my van for a great price and my payment is only $180 per month. My insurance is also pretty cheap; it's about $30 per month. I know some people who don't owe anything on their van, and some who pay upwards of $600. Loans are possible, so don't let the lack of cash stop you from vanlife. I was paying $1200 for my apartment in California before I bought Stan, not including utilities. My fuel and loan payment are much less than my house costs were, and now I have the added bonus of the freedom of the road.&nbsp;

I try not to use campsites often because my goal is to spend as little on them as possible. I prefer the privacy of the woods, and Sophie prefers the freedom of being off leash. Plus I don't want to pay to have neighbors, rules, and noise. However, sometimes I'm in an area where I can't find free camping, or I want to be closer to the location I want to photograph. In Zion, for example, I wanted to do some sunrise hikes, so camping in the park is an easier choice that driving to BLM land 30 minutes outside the park. Other places, like the California coast, don't have free camping along the highway. National forests in NorCal are not close to the beach, so if you want beach front camping, you have to pay for it. Luckily there's enough free camping everywhere else to make up for it. Campsites in National Parks, state parks and private campgrounds range from about $15-30 per night. Again, this number varies based on what area I'm traveling in, but on average I spend about $100 each month on campsites.&nbsp;

My favorite thing about living in a house is the kitchen. I love cooking, and I love all the ingredients and appliances that go with it. Unfortunately all the ingredients and appliances did not fit in the van, so now my meals are a lot more simple. I often buy the same basic ingredients and create one-pot dishes. My storage and fridge space is very small, so I couldn't spend a lot on groceries even if I wanted to. I shop more frequently, and spend around $50 a week. I try to cook most of my meals, but I do have lunch out a few times a week.&nbsp;

Whether living in a van or a house, most people have a gym membership. I wasn't going to factor this in, but I decided to because the reason I joined a gym was for showers. I prefer to get my exercise outdoors, usually through hiking. I'm just not the type to go sweat in a room with strangers. I do, however, like long, hot showers, something I don't have in the van. Not to mention the roominess; showering in a 2x2 square isn't easy. For $45 per month I'm able to shower 24/7 at any Anytime Fitness in the country. They have locations in small towns all over, which is where I usually am.&nbsp;

These are the main bills that come with vanlife. Everyone has their own set of bills to bring along, such as student loans, cell phones, health insurance, etc. It's also important to factor in a savings in case your van breaks. Unexpected problems are the norm in vanlife, so be prepared.&nbsp;
