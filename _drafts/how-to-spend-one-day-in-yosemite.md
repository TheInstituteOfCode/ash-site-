Nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains is Yosemite National Park. Famous for its striking granite slabs and rushing waterfalls, the park is enjoyed year-round by outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds. From hikers pushing to the top of Half Dome, climbers scaling the walls of El Capitan, and photographers shooting the numerous wildlife and scenery, there's something for everyone to enjoy here. &nbsp;Yosemite is the kind of place you could spend weeks in, but if you aren't burdened with that much free time, fear not! In one day it's possible to see all of the sights that make Yosemite so well known. Here are my tips for spending one day in Yosemite!

**Getting into the Park**

Do yourself a favor and arrive early in the morning. Traffic into the valley often backs up and finding parking after 9 AM can be challenging. Don't worry about getting around once you park; there's a free shuttle service in the park that will bring you to all the valley floor attractions. It operates year-round and runs from 7 AM to 10 PM every day. Naturally summer is the busiest time of year, so try to plan your trip for the spring or fall if possible. The park remains open during winter, but many roads, trails and services shut down. On the plus side, if you visit in winter you'll practically have the place to yourself!

There are multiple entrances to the park, but Highway 41 from the south provides the most scenic entry point. After passing through the famous Tunnel View, Yosemite valley appears in all its grandeur. Continue towards the valley floor, unless the road to Glacier Point is open. The detour will cost you at least 90 minutes depending on traffic, but the views are worth the delay. Here you can enjoy spectacular views of the valley floor, El Capitan and Half Dome. If the road isn't open, continue to the valley floor where you can still see all the sights that make Yosemite so magnificent.

**Chasing waterfalls in Yosemite**

If you only have one day to spend in Yosemite, there are several different hikes you can do. Coming from Highway 41, your first stop will be Bridal Veil Falls. &nbsp;This trail is open year-round, and an easy half-mile walk will bring you to the base of the waterfall. Make sure you're prepared with waterproof clothing as you will get wet! Continue into the valley and stop off at the next destination, the valley meadow. Here you can walk on the wooden path through the meadow for spectacular 360 views of the park. The plant life in Yosemite is fragile, so make sure you don't stray from paths and trails. Give the plants a chance to grow!

The three best day hikes in Yosemite are Mirror Lake, Vernal Falls, and Yosemite Falls. Mirror Lake is an easy 5 mile loop trail, but I opted to go to the lake and back, which was 2 miles round trip. It's a beautiful trail lined with giant boulders and 150 foot trees, and leads to a small lake that reflects the surrounding granite walls of Yosemite. The hike to the top of Vernal Falls is more difficult, but also more rewarding. The trail is 2.5 miles round trip and gains 1,000 feet of elevation along the way. Be prepared with waterproof clothing and camera protection because the trail can get very wet!

You can continue on the trail to Nevada Falls, for a 5.5 mile total journey. This route adds on an extra 1,000 feet of elevation gain, but the spectacular views of the 594 foot Nevada Falls are worth the extra effort! Both the Mirror Lake and Vernal Falls trail head are located near Half Dome Village. Find parking in the area, and when you're finished celebrate your accomplishments with pizza and beer at the cafe!

**Hiking to the top of Yosemite Falls&nbsp;**

If you have your eye on Yosemite Falls, drive around the valley floor loop until you reach Camp 4, or get off at shuttle stop 7. Parking here is for reserved campers only, so find a spot in the day use parking lot across the street. This is a tough trail, but hiking to the top of the highest waterfall in North America ain't easy! The first mile of the trail is switchbacks through the forest that bring yo 1,000 feet up to Colombia Rock, where you'll have amazing views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and Sentinel Rock. Keep going for another half mile for views of Upper Yosemite Falls, for a total of 3 miles round trip.

From here you can head back to the valley floor, or keep going up the trail to the top of Yosemite Falls. This journey is 7.2 miles round trip and you'll gain 2,700 feet elevation. I'm definitely on the out-of-shape side, and this hike took me about 8 hours round trip. If you decide to hike the full trail, start early in the day as you'll want to be descending before the sun starts disappearing in the afternoon. The trail is very steep and rocky so make sure you're prepared with proper shoes, plenty of water, and maybe even hiking poles. I certainly wish I had some on the way down. The views from the top are incredible and worth the effort, but you will feel the burn!

If you still want to see Yosemite Falls without all the work, take the short, paved walkway to the base of the waterfall, accessed from shuttle stop 6. The snow pack in the Sierras was impressive this year, turning all of Yosemite's waterfalls into thundering beauties. The mist coming off the falls in April was so strong, I literally got soaked through! All of my photos came out blurry from so much mist on the lens!

*Pro-Tip: Be sure to bring your poncho!*

If you only have one day in the park and you want to take it easy, I recommend doing the short walk to Bridal Veil Falls, the 2 mile out-and-back to Mirror Lake, and the short walk to the base of Yosemite Falls. If you're feeling a bit more energetic, try to squeeze in the 2.5 mile hike to Vernal Falls and the 3 mile hike to the Lower Yosemite Falls viewpoint. For an even more epic day, hike to Upper Yosemite falls for bragging rights and some of the best views the park has to offer. No matter which hike you decide to do, or if you don't hike at all, Yosemite is a magical and wondrous place that you're sure to enjoy!
