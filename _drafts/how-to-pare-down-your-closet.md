  So, you’ve finally decided to buy a van. Hooray! Congratulations and let me
  officially welcome you to the van life nation! So where do you go from here?
  If you’ve made it this far, you probably already have an idea of what you’re
  looking for. If not, let’s start with the basics.

Paring down your closet can be a big challenge. When packing my apartment to move into my van, I knew there were going to be some items I didn't want to part with, that I would definitely use in the future. I filled two boxes with things to put in storage, and then another two boxes with my seasonal clothes. I revisit these boxes every spring and fall and pack my van accordingly.&nbsp;

When paring down your closet, think about the items that you use most. Even if you have a full closet, you likely only use a handful of these items. If you haven't worn it in 3 months and it's not a seasonal item, don't bring it into your van. I brought several tank tops, maybe 10 t-shirts and a few long sleeves with me. I also brought a weeks worth of pants and leggings and about the same number of shorts. Know you like to wear most and pack accordingly. I brought two "pretty" shirts with me in case I went out, but I haven't worn them once. If I can't go in my t-shirt, I'm not going at all! The clothes I brought into the van are all very practical. They're durable fabrics that don't need special washing or care. Ain't nobody got time for that.&nbsp;

In my van I have a proper closet space. It's about two feet wide and three feet tall, with a small shelf. There's enough hanger space to hang all of my shirts and a few hoodies. I probably have more clothes than I need, but sometimes I don't get to the laundromat for a few weeks, I need enough to get me by. On the shelf I keep my extra shoes. I have a pair of hiking boots, winter boots, athletic shoes, ballet flats, and 3 pair of sandals. In addition to the closet, I have two drawers that I assign clothes to. The first contains my shorts, pants, and underwear, and the second contains big jackets, scarves, gloves and hats.&nbsp;

In another drawer I keep laundry soap, dryer sheets, and a mesh bag. Even though it takes up valuable space, it's cheaper to keep a jug of soap in the van than buying it per load at a laundromat. I also store my dirty clothes in this drawer to keep them separated.&nbsp;
