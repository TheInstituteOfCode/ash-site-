  One of the first questions people have when I tell them I live in a van, is
  "how do you shower?" This was my first question as well, so after a little
  trial and error, I put together a list of the 5 best ways to shower when you
  live in a van.

The number two (hehe) question I get asked is, "where do you poop?" It's a funny way to start a conversation, but it's certainly a good ice breaker! Here's my list of 5 best places to poop when you live in a van

1. In your van! My van has an RV style toilet that flushes into a holding tank that I empty about once a week. Having a bathroom in my van was important to me, and it's definitely worth the extra effort to maintain. If you're planning to convert a van, I highly recommend allowing space for a bathroom, even if it's just for a composting toilet.&nbsp;

2. Stay at campgrounds with bathrooms. Many free campgrounds offer vault toilets, and some cheaper campgrounds offer flushing toilets with running water. Paying for campgrounds can add up if you're on a budget, but sometimes you just need a toilet.&nbsp;

3. Rest stops and other public restrooms. Most highways have rest areas every 50 miles, which makes using the bathroom easy while on the road. Gas stations are another great option as they're even more frequent than rest stops. Also, coffee shops, restaurants, visitor centers, and shopping areas. There's a lot of public toilets out there, just waiting to be used by you!

4. Buy a portable toilet. Although not my first choice, many people use portable toilets in their vans while camping. Essentially it's a bucket with a bag inside and a toilet seat on top. Inside the bag is a deodorizing liquid that you add, which keeps things fresh for a few days. You can buy portable toilets, or make them just like I described.&nbsp;

5. Learn to poop in the woods! Go the classic camper route and answer the call of nature, in nature. Make sure you dig a deep hole that's far away from any water sources. This is my least favorite method, but sometimes you do what you need to!
