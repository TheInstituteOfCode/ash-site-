One of the first questions people have when I tell them I live in a van, is "how do you shower?" This was my first question as well, so after a little research, I put together a list of the 5 best ways to shower when you live in a van.

## **Buy or build a van that has a shower**

If you're converting a sprinter van, they usually have enough room that you can designate space for a shower. Some people add a toilet as well, but that adds extra work that not everyone wants to deal with. If you decide to purchase a new travel van, it will most likely have a bathroom. Even the older models of travel vans, like my 2003 Pleasure Way, have a toilet and convertible shower inside the van.

## **Purchase a portable shower**

[Big Kahuna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KK2F84G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00KK2F84G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=aa20b8d599a5737a3413bd393a83ce88) makes an amazing portable shower that runs off your vehicles 12V battery. The shower comes in different sizes and provides a strong, steady stream of water. In addition to showering, the Big Kahuna is great for washing dogs and cleaning all your gear. A smaller option is the&nbsp;[Ivation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IFHFJXI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00IFHFJXI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=ab0904dc7ef072a240c776ff00c68ccd) portable shower head. Also battery operated, this shower head lets you turn a bucket of water or sink into a shower. Another option is a solar shower that you hang to produce water flow. Fill the shower bag with water and leave it in the sun for a few hours to create a nice, warm shower. You can also buy portable shower tents if you need a little extra privacy and don't want to shower in your swimsuit.

&nbsp;

## **Stay at campgrounds that have showers**

This is an expensive option, especially if you're on a budget, but the occasional campground is a nice way to take a hot shower. KOA campgrounds are a great choice as they offer laundry facilities and have water and dumps. You can save money by paying for a tent site if you don't need any RV hook-ups.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Get a gym membership**

There are a few chain gyms that have multiple locations around the west coast. I think Planet Fitness offers memberships for around $20 per month, but I opted for Anytime Fitness. They're more expensive ($45) but they have more locations to choose from. Most locations are accessible 24/7 and have clean, spacious showers to use. Plus you can get a workout too!

## **Bathe in lakes, rivers, and streams**

If the weather is nice, take advantage of bathing in the great outdoors. Make sure you're only using biodegradable soaps, like [Dr. Bronner's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0TLYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001B0TLYE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=93715a1e0a5d86739f0d277732e03b1e), so you don't damage the environment. This option isn't always available year-round, so if you get the chance, go for it!

## Use baby wipes

This last one isn't really an option for me, but some vanlifers go the classic camping route of freshening up with wet wipes. Every time I try using them, I just feel slightly less gross, not necessarily clean. Wet wipes are an emergency option for me, and I don't recommend using them as your only cleaning method.

There are many ways to stay clean while living in a van! It's definitely not as easy as walking into a house shower and just turning hot water on, but with a little effort you can still maintain good hygiene while living on the road!
