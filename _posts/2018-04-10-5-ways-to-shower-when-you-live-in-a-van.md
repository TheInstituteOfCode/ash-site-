One of the first questions people have when I tell them I live in a van, is "how do you shower?" This was my first question as well, so after a little trial and error, I put together a list of the 5 best ways to shower when you live in a van.

1. Buy or build a van that has a shower. If you're converting a sprinter can, they usually have enough room that you can allocate space for a shower. Some people add a toilet as well, but that adds extra work that not everyone wants to deal with. If you decide to purchase a new travel van, it will most likely have a bathroom. Even the older models of travel vans, like my 2003 Pleasure Way, have a toilet and convertible shower inside the van.&nbsp;![](/uploads/untitled-1-of-1-16-3.jpg)

2. Purchase a portable shower. [Big Kahuna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KK2F84G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00KK2F84G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=aa20b8d599a5737a3413bd393a83ce88) makes an amazing portable shower that runs off your vehicles 12V battery. The shower comes in different sizes and provides a strong, steady stream of water. In addition to showering, the Big Kahuna is great for washing dogs and cleaning all your gear. A smaller option is the&nbsp;[Ivation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IFHFJXI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00IFHFJXI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=ab0904dc7ef072a240c776ff00c68ccd) portable shower head. Also battery operated, this shower head lets you turn a bucket of water or sink into a shower. Another option is a solar shower that you hang to produce water flow. Fill the shower bag with water and leave it in the sun for a few hours to create a nice, warm shower. You can also buy portable shower tents if you need a little extra privacy and don't want to shower in your swimsuit.&nbsp;

3. Stay at campgrounds that have showers. This is an expensive option, especially if you're on a budget, but the occasional campground is a nice way to take a hot shower. KOA campgrounds are a great choice as they offer laundry facilities and have water and dumps. You can save money by paying for a tent site if you don't need any RV hook-ups.&nbsp;![](/uploads/untitled-1-of-1-17-1-2.jpg)

4. Get a gym membership. There are a few chain gyms that have multiple locations around the west coast. I think Planet Fitness offers memberships for around $20 per month, but I opted for Anytime Fitness. They're more expensive ($45) but they have more locations to choose from. Most locations are accessible 24/7 and have clean, spacious showers to use. Plus you can get a workout too!

5. Bathe in lakes, rivers, and streams. If the weather is nice, take advantage of bathing in the great outdoors. Make sure you're only using biodegradable soaps, like [Dr. Bronner's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0TLYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001B0TLYE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashleyandthev-20&amp;linkId=93715a1e0a5d86739f0d277732e03b1e), so you don't damage the environment. This option isn't always available year-round, so if you get the chance, go for it!

This last one isn't really an option for me, but some vanlifers go the classic camping route of freshening up with baby wipes. Every time I try using them, I just feel slightly less gross, not necessarily clean. Baby wipes are an emergency option for me, and I don't recommend using them as your only cleaning method.&nbsp;

There are many ways to stay clean while living in a van! It's definitely not as easy as walking into a house shower and just turning hot water on, but with a little effort you can still maintain good hygiene while living on the road!
