    I'm Ashley, a California native who now lives full-time on the road. Photography is my passion, and I realized that in order to pursue my dreams of being a photographer, I needed to have a mobile lifestyle. In June of 2017, I packed up my apartment and bought Stan the van. Although not always easy, vanlife is the adventure of a lifetime and I'm so grateful to be living my dream. My hobbies include traveling, hiking, scuba diving, and petting all the dogs, everywhere I go! I'm so excited that you've decided to join along for my journey, and I hope to inspire you to create your own adventures too!

  Sophie is a 7 year young Queensland Heeler and Pit Bull mix. I rescued her when she was just 12 weeks old, and we've been inseparable ever since. Sophie is a huge fan of frisbee and fetch, and will always choose toys over treats. When she's not searching for new sticks in the forest, you can find her soaking up sun rays or helping out with her favorite chore, washing dishes.&nbsp; Sophie is the love of my life and my best friend, I'm so lucky to be sharing this journey with her!

  Stan the van is a 2003 Pleasure Way RV, built onto a Chevy 3500. His first owner was an older woman who put just 25,000 miles on him. I bought him in June of 2017 after realizing that van life was something I wanted to pursue. Although not the prettiest or coolest van in the bunch, Stan is fully loaded and equipped with almost everything I want in a van. He has a full bathroom (sink, toilet and shower) with gray and black water tanks, and 30 gallons of fresh water. The kitchen has a sink, two burner stove, fridge and small freezer that run off propane. In the back is a huge bed that converts into two couches, and outside is a small platform that allows for extra storage. Stan even has a few, fun extras, like an outdoor shower and heater! One day I'd love to convert my own van, but for now Stan provides everything I need to comfortably live on the road.
